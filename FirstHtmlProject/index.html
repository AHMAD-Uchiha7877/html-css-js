              When did the taco first make an appearance in the U.S. and where?
              What groups were instrumental in making it popular here?
            </summary>
            <p>
              IThe first mention that I have seen [in the U.S.] is in 1905, in a
              newspaper. That‚Äôs a time when Mexican migrants are starting to
              come‚Äîworking the mines and railroads and other such jobs. In the
              United States, Mexican food was seen as street food, lower-class
              food. It was associated with a group of women called the Chili
              Queens and with tamale pushcarts in Los Angeles. The Chili Queens
              of San Antonio were street vendors who earned a little extra money
              by selling food during festivals. When tourists started arriving
              in the 1880s with the railroad, these occasional sales started to
              become a nightly event. Tourists came looking for two things in
              San Antonio‚Äîthe Alamo and the Chili Queens. Mexico was considered
              a dangerous place. The Chili Queens were a way of sampling that
              danger, but not at the risk of being robbed by bandits. The risk
              was that the food was hot‚Äîpeople described it as ‚Äúbiting like a
              serpent.‚Äù These women were also sexualized and seen as
              ‚Äúavailable.‚Äù So the idea was that you would flirt with the Chili
              Queens. I think that image of [something] exotic, slightly
              dangerous, but still appealing has really persisted with Mexican
              food. (source:<cite
